This algorithm in TensorFlow (for a Master-postgraduates project), uses a feedforward neural network with multiple dense layers for image classification of clothing items. 
Several training methods are explored, including full batch and mini batch gradient descent, and L2 regularisation is applied to improve model performance by reducing overfitting.
